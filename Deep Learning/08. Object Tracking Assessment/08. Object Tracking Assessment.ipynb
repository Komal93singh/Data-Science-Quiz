    "The correct answer is: **3. Particle filter** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Occlusion** occurs when the tracked object is partially or fully hidden by other objects. Handling occlusions requires the tracker to **predict the object’s position even when it is not visible**.\n",
    "* **Particle filters** (also called **Sequential Monte Carlo methods**) are widely used for this because they maintain **multiple hypotheses (particles) about the object’s state**. Even if the object is temporarily occluded, some particles can continue tracking the likely position, allowing recovery once the object reappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Background subtraction** – Detects moving objects by separating foreground from background; it **cannot handle occlusion** well.\n",
    "2. **Kalman filter** – Good for **linear motion and Gaussian noise**, but struggles with **non-linear motion and occlusion**.\n",
    "3. **Optical flow** – Tracks motion of pixels between frames; can fail when the object is occluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, particle filters are specifically designed to **handle uncertainty**, making them suitable for occlusions."

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **video compression**, consecutive frames are often very similar. Instead of storing every frame fully, compression algorithms use **motion vectors** to describe how blocks of pixels move from one frame to the next.\n",

    "3. **Increasing frame rate** – Motion vectors don’t affect frame rate.\n",
